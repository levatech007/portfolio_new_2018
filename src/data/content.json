  "about": {
      "title": "Highly motivated and creative web developer with a background in fashion design and commerce.",
      "p1": "Born and raised in Tallinn, Estonia, I’ve lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for 16 years. After receiving my BFA in fashion design, life took me on a path towards graphic design and commerce. I started out as a self-taught programmer with the help of online classes while working full time co-leading a retail store. It was coding that kept me engaged and challenged. I decided to take the risk to make a career change and attend General Assembly’s full-time Web Development program.",
      "p2": "When I am not coding, you can find me either curled up on the couch reading a book, or at Bayfront Park plane spotting, marveling at the physics in motion. I also love to travel and my list of places to visit extends from here to the moon."
